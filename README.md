# swift-select
Swift Select - A PowerPoint Add-In to give you FULL CONTROL in selecting items on your slide. {In Development Currently}

Howdy! So this will be the future home for a new Add-In called SwiftSelect. I'm still working on it.  Wanna know what's taking so long? The design...  I am terrible at designing but I think you will be happy with what I am going for. I strive to keep my add-ins compact, easy to use, vivid, and fun.

Stay tuned for this when it comes out. I think it will be big!!!
