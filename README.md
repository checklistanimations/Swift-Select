# Swift-Select
Swift Select - A PowerPoint Add-In to give you FULL CONTROL in selecting items on your slide. {In Development Currently}

<h4>So what does FULL CONTROL mean?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Select by fill color</li>
  <li>Select by line color</li>
  <li>Select if shape has text or animation</li>
  <li>Select by shape type (oval, rectangle etc)</li>
  <li>Select with lasso concept even when other shapes are in the way</li>
  <li>Create selection groups</li>
  <li>Export all shapes and select by nearly any property like size, positon, z-index, partial name match</li>
</ul>

<p>And lots more</p>
<p>So what's taking so long?  The design...  I am terrible at designing but I think you will be happy with what I am going for. I strive to keep my add-ins compact, easy to use, vivid, and fun.</p>
<p>Getting there though.  Stay tuned for this... when it comes out.. I think it will be very useful.</p>
